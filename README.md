# Blockchain-Technologies---Assignment-1

## Project Description

This project demonstrates the implementation of a smart contract to handle Ether transactions, including functionalities such as receiving funds, checking balance, and allowing the owner to withdraw funds. The project also involves setting up the Web3.js library, configuring Ganache for local blockchain testing, deploying the smart contract, and interacting with it using Metamask.

## Features

### Smart Contract Functionalities:
- **Receive Ether**: Allows the smart contract to accept Ether tokens.
- **Check Balance**: Enables users to view the current balance of the smart contract.
- **Withdraw Funds**: The contract owner can withdraw all Ether stored in the contract.

### Environment Configuration:
- Installation and setup of **Web3.js**.
- Integration with **Ganache** for local blockchain or deployment on a public test network.
- Configuration of **Metamask** for blockchain interaction.

### Deployment:
- Deploy the smart contract locally using **Ganache** or on a public Testnet.

### Interaction:
- Execute contract functionalities via Web3.js scripts or Metamask interface.
